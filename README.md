### Autoencoder for Anomaly Detection

This repository contains a Python implementation of an autoencoder designed for anomaly detection in multidimensional data. Autoencoders are a type of neural network used for unsupervised learning, capable of learning a compressed representation of input data. In the context of anomaly detection, autoencoders can learn to reconstruct normal data while struggling to reconstruct anomalies, thereby identifying them through the reconstruction error.

### Implementation Details

The autoencoder is implemented using the PyTorch library, a popular choice for deep learning applications. The model consists of two main components: the encoder and the decoder. The encoder compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional representation, and the decoder attempts to reconstruct the input data from this compressed form.

* Encoder: Maps the input data to a lower-dimensional space using a linear layer followed by a ReLU activation function.

* Decoder: Attempts to reconstruct the input data from the encoded representation using a linear layer followed by a ReLU activation function.

### Data Preparation

The script generates synthetic data to simulate "normal" and "anomalous" data points. This data is then used to train the autoencoder. The normal data follows a standard normal distribution, while the anomalous data is generated with a different mean and variance, making it statistically distinguishable from the normal data.

### Training

The autoencoder is trained using the mean squared error (MSE) loss between the input and the reconstructed data, optimizing the parameters with the Adam optimizer. This process adjusts the weights to minimize the reconstruction error for normal data, thereby indirectly learning to identify anomalies based on their higher reconstruction error.

### Anomaly Detection

After training, the model is used to compute the reconstruction error for new data points. Anomalies are detected by comparing the reconstruction error to a threshold, determined as a quantile of the reconstruction errors of the normal training data. Data points with a reconstruction error above this threshold are flagged as anomalies.

### Results Visualization

The script includes visualization of:

The distribution of the normal and anomalous data.
The reconstruction errors for both normal and anomalous data, highlighting the chosen threshold for anomaly detection.
